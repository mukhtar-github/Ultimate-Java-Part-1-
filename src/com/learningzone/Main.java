// 1-GETTING STARTED

// 1- Setting Up the Development Environment

//In this Java tutorial, we're going to download and install the necessary tools to build Java applications. So open up
//your browser and search for JDK download. JDK is short for Java Development Kit, and it's basically software
//development environment for building Java applications. It has a compiler, it ahs a bunch of code that we could reuse,
//it has a Java runtime environment and a bunch of other stuff. Head over to oracle.com to download Java SE which is
//short for 'Java Standard Edition'. Now the next piece of software we need is a code editor. There are so many code
//editors for building Java applications. The popular one are Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ. In this Java course I'm
//going to use IntelliJ.
